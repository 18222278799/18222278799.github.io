In June 2020, I received my Master degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). Prior to this, I received my BS degree from Nankai University in June 2017.

My current research interests include Natural Language Processing (especially BioNLP), Data mining, Artificial intelligence and so on.
